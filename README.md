# Preliminary Training Guides


***Welcome to the R Training Program!***

To ensure a smooth and productive experience, please install all
necessary software and packages before the training date, **April 12,
2025**. Completing the installation in advance will help us focus
entirely on the training content without delays.

**Important:** On the training day, we will not provide assistance with
software installations. Participants who have not completed the setup
may find it challenging to follow along.

If you encounter any issues during the installation process, feel free
to reach out via email: <rey.cuenca@g.msuiit.edu.ph>.

To guide you through the setup, please refer to the following resources
***in order***:

  Packages](installing-using-and-removing-rpackages.html)
- [Required Packages for Training](required-packages-for-training.html)

We look forward to your participation in the training.
